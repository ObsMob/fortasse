# Bomb-Boinger
a simple CLI Terminal Mine-sweeper clone

## Usage: 
Download or Clone project and run main.py, e.g. ```"python3 main.py"```

## Features:
- Some game-play options such as *"Corners Touch = True"* and win tracking.
- Uses Unicode emojis for tile display.ðŸ’£ðŸš©
- Standard CLI prompt for navigation and game actions.

## Future Content:
1. Implementing a GUI to render shapes other than Squares.
2. Basic UI functionality like tracking an "Esc" stroke as "Back", "Quit", or *null* input.
3. Implement some logic that "removes" random tiles creating "holes" in the board, for game-play texture.
4. More UI functionality in displaying some relevant game "options" during play for reference.
5. Add colored "sections" to the game board, again for more texture.
6. Implement WASD/Arrow navigation, with toggle.

## Last Update Added:
1. Boards generated are now 100% logically deducable! (No toggle option)
2. Option: "Restart" on fail, now reuses same initial tile reveal.
