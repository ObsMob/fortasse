# Bomb-Boinger
a simple CLI terminal Minesweeper clone

## Usage: 
Download or clone the project and run main.py, e.g. ```"python3 main.py"```

## Features:
- Some gameplay options, such as *"Corners Touch = True"* and win tracking.
- Uses Unicode emojis for tile display. ðŸ’£ðŸš©
- Standard CLI prompt for navigation and game actions.

## Future Content:
1. Implementing a GUI to render shapes other than Squares.
2. Basic UI functionality like tracking an "Esc" stroke as "Back", "Quit", or *null* input.
3. Implement some logic that "removes" random tiles, creating "holes" in the board, for gameplay texture.
4. More UI functionality in displaying some relevant game "options" during play for reference.
5. Add colored "sections" to the game board, again for more texture.
6. Implement WASD/arrow navigation, with toggle.

## Last Update Added:
1. Boards generated are now 100% logically deducible! (No toggle option)
2. The "Restart" option on fail now reuses the same initial tile reveal.
