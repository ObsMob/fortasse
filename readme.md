## Future Content:
1. Implementing a GUI to render shapes other than Squares.
2. Basic UI functionality like tracking an "Esc" stroke as "Back", "Quit", or *null* input.
3. Implement some logic that "removes" random tiles creating "holes" in the board, for game-play texture.
4. More UI functionality in displaying some relevant game "options" during play for reference.
5. Implement an algorithm that can parse the randomly generated board to force a board that is 100% logically deducable + Toggle option.
6. Add colored "sections" to the game board, again for more texture.
7. Implement WASD/Arrow navigation, with toggle.
